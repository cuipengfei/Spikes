| 2 threads in the same java process<br/><br/>thread 1 somehow never releases the lock<br/><br/> thread 2 calls expireUnusedOlderThan    | thread 2 can get lock if its call to expireUnusedOlderThan method is after TTL<br/> <br/>thread 2 can NOT get lock if its call to expireUnusedOlderThan method is before TTL, in this case, we can **retry get lock for N times(each time call the expireUnusedOlderThan method) to increase the chance of getting lock** |
| 2 threads in 2 different java process<br/><br/>thread 1 somehow never releases the lock<br/><br/> thread 2 calls expireUnusedOlderThan | thread 2 can get lock after TTL, not before TTL, in other words, calling expireUnusedOlderThan won't forcefully take the lock from worker 1                                                                                                                                      |
